					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>
						I'm a Computer Engineer who is driven to comprehend the intricacy of
						modern processors and their interaction with users through the
						software interfaces. <br /><br />
						For me, nothing is more satisfying than finally unravelling the
						mystery under this laptop which I'm typing on. <br /><br />
						As much of an independent learner as I am, I understand that my
						responsibilities take precedence over my personal interests in a team setting. I
						thrive in collaborative, fast-paced environments where 
						there are rapid but productive discussions.
